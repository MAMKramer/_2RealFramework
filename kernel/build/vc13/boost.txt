boost:

- version 1.55

- build cmd: bjam link=shared runtime-link=shared threading=multi toolset=msvc-12.0

- include dir = $(BOOST) -> all includes start with "boost/"

- lib dir = $(BOOST_DIR)/stage/lib

- #define BOOST_ALL_DYN_LINK for dynamic linking, otherwise linker looks for static libraries ( error msg: "libboost*.lib" vs "boost*.lib" )
