dlls

get dll loading working on MSW ( just going to take some code from poco )
get bundle loading working
write test bundle ( without datatypes ) & get bundle metatdata working

open question: bundle dir ( env variable ), relative paths etc?

datatypes

write test bundle + datatypes

Metainfo Id:

bundle ( unique path on pc, name not necessarily )
block ( unique name in bundle )
type ( unique name in bundle )
io slot ( unique name in block )

ONCE THE ENGINE IS DEAD, EVERYTHING, INCLUDING CUSTOM TYPES, BECOMES INVALID :)

custom type:

getName -> name
getBundleName -> bundle name

-> call getTypemetainfo in bundle

createTypeMetainfo -> place request in bundle metainfo, ctor thread creates this shit?
make custom data: always problematic

clone: clones all subfields -> i need the fucking new metainfo id to clone

so:

makeData mainly called from application, which controls engine

getBundleMetainfo: shared_ptr auf bundle metainfo created by engine

-> tell engine which types exist ( names )

getTypeMetainfo: shared_ptr auf type metainfo created by engine
-> fields which themselves are custom types? -> bundle handle, can grab handle to metainfo

getBlockMetainfo: same as above

tell engine which blocks exist: name, number of inlets, number of outlets, number of parameters
each block: update policy

setDescription
setUpdatePolicy -> allocated, copy
setInlet( )


getTypeMetainfo

TypeMetainfo::
std::vector< std::pair< std::string, TypeMetainfo > >

@ type metainfo: one big type collection, contains basic types ( on init! )
bundle: on unload removes all types -> no more shitty export needed
