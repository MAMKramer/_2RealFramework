dlls

get dll loading working on MSW ( just going to take some code from poco )
get bundle loading working
write test bundle ( without datatypes ) & get bundle metatdata working

open question: bundle dir ( env variable ), relative paths etc?

datatypes

write test bundle + datatypes

PROBLEMO w. TYPES EXPORTED BY BUNDLE: IF YOU DELETE THE BUNDLE, THE DATA MUST BE GONE AS WELL
