datatypes

to add a type:

-make sure there's a default ctor

CHANGE 08/08/12: due the new 'hasChanged' function concerning inlets, 
all datatypes now must have a == operator!

-if the class internally handles owned pointers,
	make sure that there's a cpy ctor & assignment operator
	that creates deep copies

-in datatypes\_2RealType.h:
	add an element to the Type::Code enum, which will represent the type

-in datatypes\_2RealTypes.h:
	add a specialization for the desired type: as type, use the new addition to the enum
	as category, use TypeCategory::UNIQUE

-if the type should be written to & read from xml files:
	add a specialization to in datatypes\_2RealTypeStreamOperators.h
	for big types like an image, this probably makes no sense
