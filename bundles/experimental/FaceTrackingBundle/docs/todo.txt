* performance with mutexes: split up getImage and use different mutexes so the different gets don't lock each other out (@robert: WUT?)
* possible performance improvement for facetracker: before scanning whole image for faces, search in areas faces were previously at (with some tolerance, framerate-dependent) only if unsuccessuful, or no previous face positions present, scan overall image
* figure out why this is recommended in the OpenCV book but actually feature detection (eyes, etc.) works better without

* remove all warnings
* naming conventions (members)
* write documentation
* create unittest
* clean and check in test app
* insert legal notices in include files
* add valid range for each of the inlets as soon as implemented in kernel
